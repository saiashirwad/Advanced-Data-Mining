# PAMAE: Parallel k-Medoids Clustering with High Accuracy and Efficiency

### K Medoids

* High computational complexity
* More robust to noise or outliers than K-Means
* Most common realization - **Partitioning Around Medoids** - quadratic time complexity
* K-Means - Linear time complexity with respect to the number of objects



### Efficiency problem of K-Medoids

* **Global search vs local search**

  local search improves efficiency but suffers from local optima problem
